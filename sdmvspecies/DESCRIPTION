Description: Virtual species is a good tools or technology in ecology. Create
    virtual species need user familiar with programming. This package includes
    several methods to help user to create virtual species distribution map.
    Those maps can be used for Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) study. SDM use
    environmental data for sites of occurrence of a species to predict all the sites
    where the environmental conditions are suitable for the species to persist, and
    may be expected to occur.
